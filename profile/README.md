# Welcome to CTU Rover Team! üöÄ

## About Us
We are a group of highly motivated engineering students from the Czech Technical University (CTU) dedicated to representing our university in prestigious international rover competitions. Our mission is to create a space for the self-realization of young talented students with a passion for robotics and mechatronics. We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by providing hands-on experience in building innovative rover solutions.

## üåü What We Do
- Design and build a rover for the [European Rover Challenge (ERC)](https://roverchallenge.eu/competitor-zone/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAi6uvBhADEiwAWiyRdoO2C_2pj06AMVQpyveaTIL6tsv4tTwNlUBgHuopx4FWQUm3W8wQBBoCKTMQAvD_BwE)
- Collaborate on cutting-edge robotics projects
- Provide a platform for students to apply theoretical knowledge in practice
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies We Use
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
- CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software
- Python
- C/C++
- Matlab
- Docker
